        <H1 class="counter1">Flooring</H1>
      <p>There are many ways to reduce carbon footprints, waste, and energy use. For example, by purchasing sustainable flooring, such as LVP, (luxury vinyl planking) bamboo flooring, or rubber flooring, it is possible to reduce the amount of waste produced when flooring reaches the end of its career. Instead of being sent to a landfill, many of these flooring options can be recycled and reused. </p>

      <H1 class="counter1">Solar Panels</H1>
      <p> Another great way to foster sustainability is the use of solar panels. Solar panels can be installed to reduce reliance upon energy derived from fossil fuels. Making lifestyle changes and using sustainably sourced products are also good ways to aid green transition. Even minute details such as the placement and maintenance of windows can minimize the use of heating and air conditioning, furthering energy savings.</p>
